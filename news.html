            <h1>DA brings onion credit programs closer to farmers in Central Luzon</h1>
            <p>To raise awareness on available government programs aimed at enhancing the productivity and
                competitiveness of onion growers, the Department of Agriculture (DA) held the Information Caravan on
                Agri Credit Programs for Onion Farmers on September 14, 2023 in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija.

                “Our ultimate goal is national self-sufficiency. Ensuring that our farmers have wider access to credit
                and insurance is among the first steps toward the achievement of this goal. Government credit and
                insurance programs have had a long history of service to the agriculture sector in this respect,” Senior
                Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban said

                He added that government credit and insurance programs permit farmers and their organizations “to pool
                their resources, reduce risks, and build capital for their enterprises.”

                “Kasabay ng aksyong pang-emerhensiya upang maiayos ang presyo ng bilihin, ipinag-utos din ng Pangulo sa
                Kagawaran ng Pagsasaka na ipagbuti at palawakin pa ang mga serbisyong pananalapi para sa mga magsasaka,”
                the DA official said.

                The onion credit caravan, which was attended by at least 120 farmers, served as a one-stop shop to learn
                about the loan and insurance program updates and requirements of government financing institutions.
                During the event, the interested and eligible farmers were also assisted by concerned agencies in
                processing their loan applications on site.

                It was led by the DA-High Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP), DA-Agricultural Credit Policy Council
                (ACPC), and the DA-Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF) as part of the government’s
                Optimization and Resiliency in the Onion Industry Network (ORION) Program to support the local onion
                industry.

                To contribute to the production of high-quality and affordable onion, the DA-ACPC launched in March 2023
                the Credit and Financing Facility for Onion Farmers under the AgriNegosyo Loan Program with a
                P500-millon fund allocation.

                The Land Bank of the Philippines, Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, New Rural Bank of San Leonardo
                Inc., ProFarmers Rural Banking Corporation, Kilusang Lima Para sa Lahat Multipurpose Cooperative, and
                the Rizal Public Market Vendors Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative also participated in the activity.

                Established under the leadership of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., the DA’s ORION Program aims at
                promoting a competitive, resilient, and profitable onion industry providing high quality, safe,
                affordable, and sustainable onion supply enough for domestic consumption.

                The ORION Program strategies include the provision of accessible credit loans that farmers can use to
                purchase equipment, establish facilities, and improve marketing activities, among others. (Gumamela

            <h1>How Solar Power Improves Coffee Farming in Southern Philippines</h1>
            <p>Throughout his five decades of farming and producing coffee in Kalamansig, Sultan Kudarat – a province in
                the island of Mindanao, the Philippines – Mariano Billedo has never experienced such ease and efficiency
                when doing his job. As President of Limulan Coffee Farmers Association, the 74 year old shared his
                colleagues’ struggles in selling unprocessed coffee beans at a low price.

                “Coffee farming is a delicate and time-consuming process that involves several steps. After three to
                four years of growth cycle, the cherries are ready to be harvested and selected. In the absence of
                processing equipment, the beans are manually processed to remove the outer layer and pulp, followed by
                manual drying, sorting, roasting and packaging. But after the laborious process, we can only sell them
                at a low price as raw beans,” explained Mariano.

                Since July this year, however, the situation has improved for Mariano and his fellow coffee farmers in
                the Association. Thanks to a project implemented by the Mindanao Development Authority in co-operation
                with the National Electrification Administration, and with funding from the European Union, the farmers
                can use a post-harvest processing facility powered by solar energy.

            <h1>Agricultural damages due to 'Egay,' 'Falcon' balloon to over P2.75 billion</h1>
            <p>Egay" ancd "Falcon" had caused flooding, landslides, tornadoes, etc. in various areas in the country,
                affecting the regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon the most.

                The two tropical cyclones and the intensified southwest moonsoon have already affected 14 out of 17
                regions throughout Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.


                Agricultural damages jump by almost P1 billion
                According to the NDRRMC, agricultural damages due to the said weather systems are now at P2.75 billion.
                This figure is far from the P1.93 billion in production losses on Friday.

                This had already affected over 117,033 farmers and fisherfolk throughout the nation, leaving over
                143,429 hectares of crop area damaged.

                "The estimated cost of damage to infrastructure amounting to P3,631,012,164.44 was reported in Region 1,
                Region 2, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, Region 5, Region 6,
                Region 8, Region 11, Region 12, BARMM, CAR," the council said.

                On the other hand, a total of 56,994 houses have already been damaged. While most only took partial
                damages, 2,288 homes were said to have been totally destroyed.

                A total of 232 cities and municipalities have so far declared a state of calamity, enabling the
                government to institute a price free on basic necessities.

                Over P248.32 billion of assistance have been provided to those affected by the storms in the form of
                family food packs, financial aid, etc.

                PAGASA earlier said that it expects two to three tropical storms to enter the Philippine area of
                responsibility in August 2023.

            <h1>Lettuce be inspired: Couple from Negros Occidental venture into hydroponic farming by selling picked
                lettuce</h1>
            <p>Rica Presbitero and Michael Javier, a couple from Barangay San Enrique, Negros Occidental decided to run
                a hydroponic farm as a source of income aside from handling their family business and working in the BPO
                industry, respectively. Their farm, Balai Berde Farm, through a ventilated greenhouse, grows and
                harvests at least 1,014 high-quality lettuces divided into four croppings.
                Javier ventured into agribusiness after he was both inspired and alarmed by an online article he read
                predicting the
                decrease in food production that may lead to food insecurity in the Philippines. “The article mentioned
                that 10 to 15
                years from now, the number of farmers will decline, since presently, the majority of the local farmers
                are aged around
                50 to 55 years old,” Javier stated. In addition, what contributes to the crisis is the conversion of
                farmlands into
                commercial lands and establishments.
                But with the information revolution and modernization of technology, this event may be anticipated and
                prevented. “We
                discovered the hydroponic technique as the most convenient farming method since it only requires less
                manpower and
                maintenance compared to traditional farming,” Presbitero said, adding that hydroponic farming will help
                produce products
                in a short span of time without compromising their quality.
                Hydroponics farming is a method of farming that utilizes water compared to traditional farming, which
                uses soil as a
                means to grow a plant or crop. It has six types that can fit different environments and challenges,
                which are wick
                systems, water culture, ebb and flow, drip, nutrient-film technology (NFT), and aeroponic systems.

                After careful research, Javier and Presbitero employed the nutrient-film technology in their
                72-square-meter and
                20-foot-tall ventilated greenhouse farm. And since January 2023, they have produced at least 1,014
                lettuce, in different
                varieties, which are curly lettuce, red butterhead, and romaine.
                The couple discovered hydroponic farming during the pandemic while browsing the internet. They instantly
                became
                interested since they had become more cautious and conscious of their food intake due to fear of the
                widespread virus.

                “We did our own research about hydroponic farming and became interested in the process of growing plants
                and crops and
                how it is different from the traditional method,” Presbitero said.

                But what influenced them the most was the fact that most people who started hydroponic farming did not
                have any
                knowledge about the method. “Maybe we can do it as well,” Presbitero shared.
                Presbitero has a background in agriculture, since her family cultivates rice and sugarcane and her
                father graduated with
                a degree in Agribusiness. Farming is close to Presibtero’s heart and was instilled in her from a young
                age because of
                its importance to people’s lives.
